# Psychic-Game

I decided to pick easier assignment for this homework. I haven't added any CSS styles to it since I only had few lines of text based on the example. 

Also, I created extra line called "Secret" that shows wich letter computer picked. This way I could check if my code counts correctly wins and loses. 

Look forward to your feedback!
